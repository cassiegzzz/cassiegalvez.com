I am an Eastern Washington University 2018 graduate, with a Bachelors degree in Visual Communication Design and certificate in User Experience Design. I was born and raised in Eastern Washington, where I currently reside. Graphic design was my first ever passion in life, besides cats, of course. I'm a firm believer in first impressions, that's why my goal is create a visual appealing look for others and their brands. 

this is just a test to see why my text isnt working plz help
